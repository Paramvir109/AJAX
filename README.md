# Ajax

This is the repo for [Udacity's Ajax course](https://github.com/udacity/course-ajax). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
